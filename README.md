# Description

TrafficOS is a vision that aims to implement a real-time infrastructure for drivers, state departments and third parties for a better experience and understanding of the traffic and how it evolves over time. The infrastructure will provide easier ways for car drivers to navigate and access services encountered along their paths, collect and share data and analytics with different entities in charge of traffic management, research institutes and service providers.

# Scope

With the rise of technologies like 5G, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, different areas in our lives need to change in order to benefit from the advantages such technologies bring. One key factor and already established foundation in our current society which helps our daily lives and businesses is transportation, no matter its type (commercial, public or private). Taking this into consideration participants and entities which help with building infrastructures and providing all the necessary needs for transportation to function properly need to collaborate in order to achieve the most optimal results. A task like this is challenging and difficult to accomplish in ways which assume a lot of human interaction and manual processes, thus the need of a fully automated system which will handle all the complex work. Having all of these presented, TrafficOS can be a solution solving the mentioned issues.

# Features

These are some of the features identified after a first research and analysis:

- See availability for parking slots, gas stations and other service providers registered in the system
- Based on severity of impact(car accident) send notifications to Police, Hospitals, Firefighter departments
- See how congested the traffic is in real-time
- Analyse based on history and predict traffic using AI engines
- Share location through mobile/web applications with relatives or close friends
- Notify relatives or close friends in case of a car accident or other unpleasant situations
- Each car to have a digital certificate with its corresponding serial number and a digital ID
- Share analytics and reports with City Hall, Police, Infrastructure and other state departments and also with third parties
- Using AI to optimise routes for vehicles dealing with urgent situations(police cars, ambulances, firefighter vehicles etc.)
- See in realtime where public and commercial transport vehicles are and receive time estimation based on your current location
- Get notified if your car is moving unintentionally(maybe it was stolen, hit etc.) after you parked it
- See in real-time roads which are blocked, under construction or out of service
- Integration with services such as Google Maps in order to display points of interest
- Get notified in real-time of events occurring near your traffic location and how these events will further impact the traffic
- Taxi companies can register in the system and provide data to help customers access their services
